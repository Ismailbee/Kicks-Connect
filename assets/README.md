# Assets Directory

This directory contains image assets for the Kicks Connect app.

## Structure
- `assets/images/` - Product images and app icons
- Place shoe product images here for display in the app
- Supported formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG

## Usage
Images are referenced in the pubspec.yaml and can be loaded using:
```dart
Image.asset('assets/images/shoe_image.png')
```

## Placeholder
For development, the app uses colored containers as placeholders until actual product images are added.
